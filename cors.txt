getting this error Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at file:///C:/Users/david/Desktop/quotes.json. (Reason: CORS request not http).
The error you're seeing is due to the Same Origin Policy, which is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to resources on a different domain or protocol. In this case, you're trying to load the quotes.json file from the local file system (file:// protocol), which is considered a different origin than your web page.

To work around this issue, you can host your JSON file on a web server (e.g. using Apache, Nginx, or a Node.js server) and access it using the http:// protocol. Alternatively, you can use a browser extension that allows you to bypass the Same Origin Policy during development (e.g. CORS Everywhere or Moesif CORS).

If you don't have access to a web server and don't want to use a browser extension, you can try running a local web server on your machine. For example, you can use Python's built-in http.server module to serve the quotes.json file:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory that contains the quotes.json file.

Run the following command to start a local web server:

Copy code
python -m http.server
This will start a web server on port 8000 and serve files from the current directory.

Open your web page in a browser and change the URL to http://localhost:8000/your-page.html (replace your-page.html with the name of your HTML file).

The JavaScript code should now be able to load the quotes.json file from the local web server without triggering the Same Origin Policy.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
